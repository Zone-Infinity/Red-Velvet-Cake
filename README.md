# Red Velvet Cake

*__**Red velvet**__ cake is much more than vanilla cake tinted red. This recipe produces the best red velvet cake with superior **buttery**, **vanilla**, and **cocoa flavors**, as well as a delicious tang from **buttermilk**. My trick is to whip the egg whites, which guarantees a smooth velvet crumb.*

*Red velvet cake is the queen of all layer cakes. The “__I can’t quite put my finger on the flavor__” cake. It’s the sweet marriage of buttermilk and vanilla with a little cocoa for good measure. She’s tall, dramatic, and completely covered in silky cream cheese frosting. This is my **best** red velvet cake.*
